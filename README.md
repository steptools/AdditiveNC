Make STEP-NC for Additive Manufacturing
--

This project parses additive manufacturing data described by a [CLI
file](https://www.forwiss.uni-passau.de/~welisch/papers/cli_format.html)
and creates a machining program as STEP-NC.


Each layer description is put into a separate workplan, the polyline
and hatches are converted to toolpaths, and the speed and power
parameters are mapped to the toolpath parameters.  A fragment of CLI
data is shown below.

## Building

This package is written in C# and contains a Visual Studio 2013
project file for building.  You also need the STEP-NC Machine DLL to
create the STEP-NC data.  A downloadable version that is free for
personal use can be found at:

STEP-NC Machine (which contains the STEP-NC DLL)
